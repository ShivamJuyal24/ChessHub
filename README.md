# ChessHub

Developed a real-time multiplayer chess game built with Node.js, Socket.IO, and Express.js for server-side functionality, and EJS, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript for the client-side interface. It features live board rendering, drag-and-drop piece movement, and role-based interactions using the Chess.js library for game logic.
